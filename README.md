## **Netlog Data Engine and Throughput calculator**

### **Overview**

The Netlog Data Engine is a Node.js script designed to parse and analyze network log (Netlog) files generated by different test server. It extracts relevant information such as byte counts, latency, HTTP stream job IDs, and socket IDs from the log files and generates structured output files for further analysis.


### **How to run**

Navigate to the project directory in the terminal. You need have access to netlog files along with the url.txt files of the experiments you want to conduct. If you do't then navigate to the '/generate_netlog' folder to get those files.  

Run the script using the following command from the root directory of the project:

    node netlog.js <directory_path_of_netlog_and_urls_files> <server_name>


Replace <directory_path_of_netlog_and_urls_files> with the path to where you can find your netlog and urls files and <server_name> should be the name of the server you're conducting this experiment for

The processed data will be written to output files in the folder structure <CARROT_(single or multi)>/<ookla_(download or upload)>/<kind of experiment>/

### **File Structure for the analysis directory**

 - netlog.js: Main Node.js script for processing Netlog data.

 - throughput_with_plot_multi.py : calculates the throughput using the bytetime and time provided by netlog.js file. this file focues on the multiple tcp flows files and also plots the charts using exponential moving average

 - throughput_with_plot_single.py : calculates the throughput using the bytetime and time provided by netlog.js file. this file focues on the single tcp flow files and also plots the charts using exponential moving average

 - execute_multi.ps1 - A script file that can run every file in the CARROT_multi directory and generate it's byte_time and latency files using the netlog file and also calculate the throughput and plot it.

- execute_single.ps1 - A script file that can run every file in the CARROT_single directory and generate it's byte_time and latency files using the netlog file and also calculate the throughput and plot it.

 - output/: Directory containing output files generated by the script.

 - testServers folder: each test server has its own folder with the netlog file and urls file.

 - README.md: This README file providing an overview of the project and instructions for usage.
